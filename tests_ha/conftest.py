"""Fixtures for the real-Home-Assistant load tests.

These tests run against the genuine ``homeassistant`` package supplied by
``pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`` (pinned in ``requirements-ha-test.txt``).
They deliberately live outside ``tests/`` so that ``tests/ha_stubs.py`` is never
imported: the whole point is to catch import paths and API changes the stubs
cannot see (see ``docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`` and the v1.0.2 post-mortem).

Only the robot I/O is faked. The coordinator, every entity platform, the config
flow and the device/entity registries are the real thing.
